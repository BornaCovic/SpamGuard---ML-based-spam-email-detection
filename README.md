# SpamGuard---ML-based-spam-email-detection
## A fully functional spam detection project which uses TF-IDF vectroization and Logistic Regression for highly accurate spam detection
The system implements an end-to-end text classification pipeline for spam detection, combining structured email parsing, text normalization, TF-IDF vectorization, and linear discriminative modeling. Emails are converted into a sparse vector space representation using n-gram features, and a Logistic Regression model is trained to learn a decision boundary in high-dimensional space. The architecture is built using Scikit-learn’s Pipeline abstraction to support clean experimentation and reproducible model training.
